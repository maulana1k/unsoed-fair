Project README
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository or download the source code.

Install the dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the required packages and dependencies for the project.

Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This command starts the development server. You can also use yarn dev or pnpm dev if you prefer using Yarn or PNPM as your package manager.

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the application.

The page auto-updates as you edit the files. You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js.

Customizing the Application
The project provides several customization options to tailor the application to your needs. Below are some subheadings that explain these options in more detail.

Editing Pages
The pages directory contains the main pages of your application. You can modify these files to create and customize the different pages of your application. Start by editing the pages/index.js file to modify the homepage.

Creating API Routes
The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/* and is used for creating API routes. You can create custom API endpoints by adding files to this directory. These files will be treated as API routes and can handle server-side logic and database operations.

Managing Styles and Assets
The project supports different approaches for managing styles and assets. You can choose to use CSS modules, CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components, or any other styling library of your choice. Similarly, you can manage assets like images and fonts by placing them in the appropriate directories within the project structure.

Optimizing and Customizing Fonts
This project utilizes next/font to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, which is a custom Google Font. You can customize the fonts used in the project by following the instructions provided in the next/font documentation.
